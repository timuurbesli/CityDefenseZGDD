- **AoE Radius:** Clash of Clans-style area targeting affects multiple soldiers

- **Timing Decisions:** Save boosts for critical moments vs immediate use

- **Positioning Strategy:** Players arrange soldiers to maximize boost effectiveness

**Multi-Layer Decision Framework:**
Players face cascading strategic choices:

1. **Collection Phase:** "Is this boost worth the distraction/risk?"

2. **Storage Management:** "Should I use this now or save for boss waves?"

3. **Targeting Phase:** "Where should I deploy this for maximum effect?"

4. **Positioning Strategy:** "Should I group soldiers to maximize boost overlap?"

- **Conflicts with Boost Collection:** Players must choose between collecting boosts or sealing holes

- **Affects Resource Planning:** Emergency holes can disrupt careful strategic planning

- **Creates Multitasking Challenges:** Players juggle multiple real-time demands simultaneously

**Atmospheric World-Building - Global News System:**
A subtle but powerful immersion system that reinforces the global apocalyptic setting and creates emotional connection to the larger world beyond the player's immediate survival situation:

**News Ticker Implementation:**

- **Continuous Flow:** News headlines scroll horizontally across the top of the screen

- **Atmospheric Content:** Reports from around the world about the zombie apocalypse

- **Immersive Examples:** "Zombies started to be seen in Antarctica as well"

- **Non-Intrusive Design:** Subtle enough not to distract from gameplay but visible enough to enhance atmosphere

**World-Building Benefits:**

- **Global Scope:** Reinforces that this is a worldwide catastrophe, not just local

- **Emotional Weight:** Players feel part of a larger struggle for humanity's survival

- **Narrative Context:** Provides backstory and lore without explicit exposition

|--------------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Resource** | Primary currency | Daily income, Factory buildings | Building cards, utility cards, base management |
| **Ammunition** | Military currency | Ammunition buildings, expeditions | Soldiers, walls, landmines, airstrikes |
| **Food** | Survival currency | Farm buildings in farm zones | Population sustenance, expeditions |
| **Population** | Capacity limit | House buildings | Maximum soldier capacity constraint |
| **Research Points** | Meta progression | Laboratory, expeditions, 3-day offerings | Permanent upgrades (11 trees, 40+ options) |

**Key Economic Mechanics:**

- **HUNGER Penalty:** -20% combat effectiveness when Food < Population

- **Population Constraint:** Cannot train soldiers beyond housing capacity

- **Strategic Balance:** Must optimize immediate survival vs long-term investment

**Manual Collection System:**

- **Click-to-Harvest:** Buildings display resource icons when ready, players click to collect

- **Visual States:** Buildings show full/empty states (similar to Clash of Clans)

- **Active Engagement:** Forces player interaction during day phases

- **Capacity Limits:** Buildings stop producing when storage full until collected

**Production & Balance:**

- **Strategic Timing:** Must balance collection with other day-phase activities

- **Efficiency Scaling:** Higher-level buildings produce more resources faster

- **Interconnected Systems:** All currencies affect each other's strategic utility

- **Dynamic Scaling:** Resource needs increase with base complexity and difficulty
