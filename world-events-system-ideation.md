# World Events System - Ideation Document

## Core Concept Overview

**Dual NPC Announcement System**: Two distinct NPCs handling different types of information to create layered narrative depth and tactical awareness.

**Key Philosophy**: Separate mission-critical information from world atmosphere, allowing players to receive tactical updates while experiencing the broader apocalyptic collapse.

## Two-NPC System Design

### NPC #1: Base Commander (Mission Progress)
**Purpose**: Mission objectives, tactical updates, local base status

- **Character**: Professional military officer coordinating your specific mission
- **Voice Style**: Calm, tactical, mission-focused
- **Visual**: Military insignia, tactical displays
- **Personality**: Competent, reliable, focused on your survival
- **Sample Line**: *"Attention team, plane repair at 60% completion. Estimated 20 days remaining."*

**ElevenLabs Voice Design:**
- **Voice Type:** Authoritative male voice with professional military cadence
- **Age Range:** 45-50 years old
- **Tone:** Composed, strategic, commanding yet supportive
- **Walkie-Talkie Effects:** The audio should include high-quality military-grade radio compression with minimal interference, precise digital clarity, and occasional tactical beeps between transmissions. The voice should come through a clean, professional military communications channel with slight digital processing and standardized military radio effects.
- **Voice Characteristics:** Clear enunciation with military brevity codes, maintains professional composure even in crisis, uses precise timing and measured pauses for important information delivery. Voice carries natural command presence while remaining approachable and supportive of the mission.

- Local tactical intelligence
- Base status reports
- Resource allocation advisories
- Immediate tactical warnings

### NPC #2: World News Speaker (Apocalyptic Atmosphere)
**Purpose**: Global situation deterioration, new zombie threats, world collapse

- **Character**: Desperate emergency broadcaster, possibly last voice on the airwaves
- **Voice Style**: Increasingly panicked, scared, breaking down over time
- **Visual**: Flickering radio signal, static interference
- **Personality**: Terrified, desperate, clinging to hope, gradually losing sanity
- **Sample Line**: *"Oh God... oh God... if anyone's still out there... the runners are everywhere now... EVERYWHERE!"*

**Handles:**
- New zombie variant warnings
- Global population statistics
- Major city/country collapse reports
- Infrastructure breakdown news
