# City Defense Z - Discarded Features List
**Target Release: August 2025 (Accelerated Timeline)**  
**Date: December 2024**

---

## Pricing Impact

**Original Pricing Strategy:** $10 with full feature set  
**Adjusted Pricing:** $5 - $7.99 maximum due to discarded features

By removing these features for the August launch, the game's value proposition requires a lower price point to match the reduced content scope. The discarded features can justify price increases through major content updates post-launch.

## Early Access Hype Risk

**The Problem:** Early access launches generate high initial hype and player expectations. If core features are missing during this critical period, player disappointment can severely damage the game's reputation and long-term success.

**Reference:** Similar issues occurred with "Eyes of War" where missing features during the hype period led to negative reception despite later improvements.

**Strategic Solution:** Rather than completely removing features, the optimal approach is to:
- Show all feature concepts to early access players
- Launch with basic implementations of key systems
- Clearly communicate the post-launch improvement roadmap
- Use early access feedback to refine and enhance features

**Risk Mitigation:** This ensures players see the game's full potential during the high-engagement early access period, while allowing time for proper implementation and polish based on real player feedback.
