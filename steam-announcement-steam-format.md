[h1]DAY 10: YOUR ARMY AWAITS[/h1]

Only [b]10 days[/b] remain until the zombies break through on [b]August 26th[/b]. The city's fate hangs in the balance, and we're about to show you exactly what you'll need to survive.

Over the coming days, we'll pull back the curtain on your survival arsenal. Each revelation will bring you closer to understanding what it truly takes to defend the last bastion of humanity.

[i][b]The countdown begins now.[/b][/i]

[h2]From Survivors to Legends[/h2]

[i][b]They started as ordinary people. Citizens. Neighbors. Friends.

Now they stand at the walls, weapons in hand, ready to face the endless night. But in City Defense Z, your soldiers are more than just defenders, they're capable of something extraordinary.

What if we told you that the frightened civilian clutching a pistol could become something more? That through experience, training, and sheer will to survive, they could transform into an unstoppable force?

Every soldier in your army carries this potential. Through our [b]merge system[/b], three become one, but that one is something far greater than the sum of its parts.

[h2]The Power of Evolution[/h2]

Watch as your defenders evolve from desperate survivors into tactical specialists. See them grow from simple firearms to devastating weaponry that can turn the tide of any battle.

But the transformation doesn't stop there. Push further, invest deeper, and witness the birth of true legends, warriors whose very presence on the battlefield strikes fear into the undead hordes.

[h2]The Choice is Yours[/h2]

Will you field an army of many, or forge a few into legends? In City Defense Z, both paths lead to survival, but only one leads to victory.

[i][b]Five levels of evolution. Countless strategic possibilities. One ultimate question: How far will you push your soldiers to save humanity?[/b][/i]

[h2]What's Next?[/h2]

The soldiers are ready, but they need more than courage to survive. Soon, we'll reveal what keeps an army fighting when the world has ended.

[i][b]Stay vigilant, Survivors...[/b][/i]
