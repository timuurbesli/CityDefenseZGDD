# City Defense Z - 3 Hours Left: We're Counting Down With You! ☕

**Just 3 hours. One more coffee. One more check.**

*[GIF: Simple countdown timer with "3 HOURS LEFT" and coffee cup emoji]*

## ☕ THE FINAL COUNTDOWN (AND LOTS OF COFFEE)

**3 HOURS LEFT**

We're sitting here at our computers, just like you probably are, counting down the hours. The coffee pot is working overtime, and honestly? We're a mix of excited and nervous.

In just 3 hours, August 26th, City Defense Z launches. After months of development, bug fixes, late nights, and countless cups of coffee, we're finally here.

## 🌍 OUR JOURNEY TOGETHER

This has been such a fun journey for us developing City Defense Z. We started with a simple idea: what if we could create a survival game that really felt like you were part of a global community fighting together?

We've poured our hearts into every zombie, every building, every strategy mechanic. We've tested and retested, balanced and rebalanced, and now we're just hoping you'll have as much fun playing it as we had making it.

**We're not a big studio with hundreds of developers.** We're a small indie team who believes in what we've built. And we believe in you - the community that's going to make this game truly special.

**3 Hours Until Launch: A Small Indie Team's Journey**

At Good Mood Games, we're in the final countdown to our biggest milestone yet.

In just 3 hours, City Defense Z launches on Steam. After months of development, countless late nights, and more coffee than we'd care to admit, we're finally here.

**The Reality of Indie Game Development**

We're a small team who believed in an idea: creating a survival game that truly feels like you're part of a global community fighting together.

The past few months have been a rollercoaster of bug fixes, community feedback integration, and the constant challenge of making every element feel just right.

**What Launch Day Really Means**

Tomorrow isn't just a release date - it's the beginning of a new chapter. We'll be monitoring player feedback in real-time, ready to push quick hotfixes, and building our roadmap around what players actually want.

**Our Commitment**

We're not launching and disappearing. We're committed to active community engagement, regular updates, and transparent communication about our development process.

Right now, we're making final preparations and honestly? We're a mix of excited and nervous. The coffee pot is working overtime.

This launch represents everything we believe in as indie developers: passion, community, and the belief that great games come from teams who care deeply about their players.

Game industry is dead. Why you ask? Isn’t it obvious? The answer is zombies… They can’t play video games as far as I know. But a studio in Ankara, Good Mood Games, is still making them like maniacs.
Oyun sektörü bitti. Neden mi diyorsun? Belli değil mi? Cevap zombiler… Bildiğim kadarıyla video oyunu oynayamıyorlar. Ama Ankara’da Good Mood Games ekibi hâlâ manyak gibi oyun yapıyor. L’industrie du jeu est morte. Tu demandes pourquoi ? N’est-ce pas évident ? La réponse, ce sont les zombies… À ma connaissance, ils ne jouent pas aux jeux vidéo. Mais à Ankara, l’équipe de Good Mood Games continue d’en faire comme des fous. L’industria dei videogiochi è morta. Chiedi perché? Non è ovvio? La risposta sono gli zombie… Per quanto ne so, non giocano ai videogiochi. Ma ad Ankara, il team di Good Mood Games continua a farne come dei pazzi. Die Spieleindustrie ist tot. Fragst du warum? Ist das nicht offensichtlich? Die Antwort lautet Zombies… Soweit ich weiß, spielen sie keine Videospiele. Aber in Ankara entwickelt das Good Mood Games-Team immer noch wie verrückt. La industria del videojuego está muerta. ¿Que por qué? ¿No es obvio? La respuesta son los zombis… Que yo sepa, no juegan videojuegos. Pero en Ankara, el equipo de Good Mood Games sigue haciéndolos como locos.
Игровая индустрия мертва. Спрашиваешь почему? Разве это не очевидно? Ответ — зомби… Насколько мне известно, они не играют в видеоигры. Но в Анкаре команда Good Mood Games всё ещё делает их, как безумные.
Branża gier jest martwa. Pytasz dlaczego? Czy to nie oczywiste? Odpowiedź to zombie… Z tego co wiem, oni nie grają w gry wideo. Ale w Ankarze ekipa Good Mood Games dalej robi gry jak wariaci.
A indústria de games morreu. Você pergunta por quê? Não é óbvio? A resposta são os zumbis… Pelo que sei, eles não jogam videogame. Mas em Ancara, a equipe da Good Mood Games ainda faz jogos como loucos.
游戏行业已经死了。你问为什么？这还不明显吗？答案就是僵尸……据我所知，他们不会玩电子游戏。但在安卡拉，Good Mood Games 团队还在疯狂做游戏。
ゲーム業界は死んだ。なぜかって？そんなの明らかだろ。答えはゾンビだ… 俺の知る限り、やつらはゲームをしない。だがアンカラでは、Good Mood Gamesのチームが今も狂ったように作り続けている。
