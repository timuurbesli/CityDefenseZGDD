# City Defense Z - 3 Hours Left: We're Counting Down With You! ‚òï

**Just 3 hours. One more coffee. One more check.**

*[GIF: Simple countdown timer with "3 HOURS LEFT" and coffee cup emoji]*

## ‚òï THE FINAL COUNTDOWN (AND LOTS OF COFFEE)

**3 HOURS LEFT**

We're sitting here at our computers, just like you probably are, counting down the hours. The coffee pot is working overtime, and honestly? We're a mix of excited and nervous.

In just 3 hours, August 26th, City Defense Z launches. After months of development, bug fixes, late nights, and countless cups of coffee, we're finally here.

## üåç OUR JOURNEY TOGETHER

This has been such a fun journey for us developing City Defense Z. We started with a simple idea: what if we could create a survival game that really felt like you were part of a global community fighting together?

We've poured our hearts into every zombie, every building, every strategy mechanic. We've tested and retested, balanced and rebalanced, and now we're just hoping you'll have as much fun playing it as we had making it.

**We're not a big studio with hundreds of developers.** We're a small indie team who believes in what we've built. And we believe in you - the community that's going to make this game truly special.

## ‚ö° WHAT HAPPENS IN 3 HOURS

**When the clock strikes launch time:**
- We'll be refreshing Steam reviews like crazy
- We'll be monitoring Discord for your first reactions
- We'll be ready to push hotfixes if needed
- We'll be celebrating every positive comment

**4 survival environments are ready for you:**

## ü§ù WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU

- Double-checking everything one last time
- Hoping we didn't miss any critical bugs
- Getting ready for some sleepless nights ahead (like our past 3 months basically nothing will change lol)

**We know you're probably doing the same - counting down, getting excited, maybe even planning your first strategies.**

**3 Hours Until Launch: A Small Indie Team's Journey**

At Good Mood Games, we're in the final countdown to our biggest milestone yet.

In just 3 hours, City Defense Z launches on Steam. After months of development, countless late nights, and more coffee than we'd care to admit, we're finally here.

**The Reality of Indie Game Development**

We're a small team who believed in an idea: creating a survival game that truly feels like you're part of a global community fighting together.

The past few months have been a rollercoaster of bug fixes, community feedback integration, and the constant challenge of making every element feel just right.

**What Launch Day Really Means**

Tomorrow isn't just a release date - it's the beginning of a new chapter. We'll be monitoring player feedback in real-time, ready to push quick hotfixes, and building our roadmap around what players actually want.

**Our Commitment**

We're not launching and disappearing. We're committed to active community engagement, regular updates, and transparent communication about our development process.

Right now, we're making final preparations and honestly? We're a mix of excited and nervous. The coffee pot is working overtime.

This launch represents everything we believe in as indie developers: passion, community, and the belief that great games come from teams who care deeply about their players.

Game industry is dead. Why you ask? Isn‚Äôt it obvious? The answer is zombies‚Ä¶ They can‚Äôt play video games as far as I know. But a studio in Ankara, Good Mood Games, is still making them like maniacs.
Oyun sekt√∂r√º bitti. Neden mi diyorsun? Belli deƒüil mi? Cevap zombiler‚Ä¶ Bildiƒüim kadarƒ±yla video oyunu oynayamƒ±yorlar. Ama Ankara‚Äôda Good Mood Games ekibi h√¢l√¢ manyak gibi oyun yapƒ±yor. L‚Äôindustrie du jeu est morte. Tu demandes pourquoi ? N‚Äôest-ce pas √©vident ? La r√©ponse, ce sont les zombies‚Ä¶ √Ä ma connaissance, ils ne jouent pas aux jeux vid√©o. Mais √† Ankara, l‚Äô√©quipe de Good Mood Games continue d‚Äôen faire comme des fous. L‚Äôindustria dei videogiochi √® morta. Chiedi perch√©? Non √® ovvio? La risposta sono gli zombie‚Ä¶ Per quanto ne so, non giocano ai videogiochi. Ma ad Ankara, il team di Good Mood Games continua a farne come dei pazzi. Die Spieleindustrie ist tot. Fragst du warum? Ist das nicht offensichtlich? Die Antwort lautet Zombies‚Ä¶ Soweit ich wei√ü, spielen sie keine Videospiele. Aber in Ankara entwickelt das Good Mood Games-Team immer noch wie verr√ºckt. La industria del videojuego est√° muerta. ¬øQue por qu√©? ¬øNo es obvio? La respuesta son los zombis‚Ä¶ Que yo sepa, no juegan videojuegos. Pero en Ankara, el equipo de Good Mood Games sigue haci√©ndolos como locos.

Bran≈ºa gier jest martwa. Pytasz dlaczego? Czy to nie oczywiste? Odpowied≈∫ to zombie‚Ä¶ Z tego co wiem, oni nie grajƒÖ w gry wideo. Ale w Ankarze ekipa Good Mood Games dalej robi gry jak wariaci.
A ind√∫stria de games morreu. Voc√™ pergunta por qu√™? N√£o √© √≥bvio? A resposta s√£o os zumbis‚Ä¶ Pelo que sei, eles n√£o jogam videogame. Mas em Ancara, a equipe da Good Mood Games ainda faz jogos como loucos.
