## Slide 2: Game Theme & Core Gameplay

### POST-APOCALYPTIC SETTING
Set in a post-apocalyptic world where every decision could mean the difference between life and death. The game explores the theme of surviving a zombie outbreak using modern-day technologies, creating something unprecedented: a game that's simple enough to learn in minutes, yet deep enough to master over hundreds of hours.

### CORE GAMEPLAY: SURVIVE PLANNED ZOMBIE ATTACKS

During calm preparation phases, you'll strategically place and merge buildings in spatial puzzles. But when night falls, the game transforms‚Äîzombie holes burst open in real-time, demanding immediate tactical responses as you manually deploy airstrikes and manage combat boosts. You're not just watching towers shoot; you're actively shaping the flow of battle.

**Day Phase (Preparation - 45-90 seconds):**

1. Receive random building cards

2. Strategic placement on grid system

3. Merge 3 adjacent buildings for upgrades

4. Deploy soldiers and plan defenses

5. Manage resources & NPC interactions

**Night Phase (Combat - 60-120 seconds):**

1. Zombie waves attack your base

2. Real-time threat response (zombie holes)

3. Manual airstrike deployment

4. Boost system activation

5. Emergency defensive measures

The goal is to survive each wave with minimal damage or loss and prepare the city for the next assault. Between attacks, players can rebuild, upgrade defenses, and expand their city.
