## Slide 2: Game Theme & Core Gameplay

### POST-APOCALYPTIC SETTING
Set in a post-apocalyptic world where every decision could mean the difference between life and death. The game explores the theme of surviving a zombie outbreak using modern-day technologies, creating something unprecedented: a game that's simple enough to learn in minutes, yet deep enough to master over hundreds of hours.

### CORE GAMEPLAY: SURVIVE PLANNED ZOMBIE ATTACKS

During calm preparation phases, you'll strategically place and merge buildings in spatial puzzles. But when night falls, the game transforms—zombie holes burst open in real-time, demanding immediate tactical responses as you manually deploy airstrikes and manage combat boosts. You're not just watching towers shoot; you're actively shaping the flow of battle.

**Day Phase (Preparation - 45-90 seconds):**

1. Receive random building cards

2. Strategic placement on grid system

3. Merge 3 adjacent buildings for upgrades

4. Deploy soldiers and plan defenses

5. Manage resources & NPC interactions

**Night Phase (Combat - 60-120 seconds):**

1. Zombie waves attack your base

2. Real-time threat response (zombie holes)

3. Manual airstrike deployment

4. Boost system activation

5. Emergency defensive measures

The goal is to survive each wave with minimal damage or loss and prepare the city for the next assault. Between attacks, players can rebuild, upgrade defenses, and expand their city.

## Slide 3: Revolutionary Features

### 🏰 YOUR BASE, YOUR PEOPLE, YOUR STORY

The heart of City Defense Z lies in its expandable NPC ecosystem. Choose from **four distinct specialist groups**—Farm experts who double your crop yields, Military veterans who boost combat effectiveness by 50%, Research scientists who accelerate technological progress, and Expedition specialists who increase survival rates and rare resource discovery.

But these aren't just stat bonuses—they're living characters. Walk around your base and you'll see your chosen specialists stationed at their posts. Click on Dr. Sarah Chen, and her voice crackles through your walkie-talkie with authentic static: *"My research shows a 23% efficiency increase if we modify the ammunition formula."*

**4 Expandable NPC Groups:**

• **🌾 Farm Group:** +100% crop harvest rate, food production bonuses

• **⚔️ Military Group:** +50% fire rate, +50% damage, +50% HP combat effectiveness  

• **🔬 Research Group:** Laboratory efficiency boosts, accelerated research point generation

• **🎯 Expedition Group:** Higher survival rates, increased exploration rewards, rare resource discovery

### ⚡ REVOLUTIONARY MERGE MECHANICS

**Building Merge System:**
• Automatic Triggering: 3 identical buildings merge instantly when adjacent
• Flexible Patterns: Horizontal, vertical, and L-shaped adjacency all valid
• Exponential Power Growth: Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3 with dramatic effectiveness increases
• Strategic Placement: Control merge location by choosing which building to place last

### 🗺️ SURVIVAL WITH PURPOSE

Unlike mindless wave-based games, every map tells a story with clear objectives. Take Map 1—the Desert Outpost. Your mission isn't just "survive indefinitely." It's *"We have to repair our planes to leave, but it will take 50 days."* When your engineer finally radios in—*"The plane is ready. We can leave whenever you want"*—you feel genuine accomplishment.

**4 Connected Maps:**
• **Desert Outpost:** 50 Days - Repair planes to escape
• **Suburban Stronghold:** 75 Days - Clear and fortify gated community
