## Implementation Notes

**Avatar Requirements:** Each NPC requires a unique portrait showing their personality and specialization through visual design elements (clothing, tools, expressions).

**Voice Acting Direction:** Each character should have distinct vocal characteristics:
- **Farm Group:** Practical, nurturing tones with rural/agricultural backgrounds
- **Military Group:** Authoritative, tactical language with military precision
- **Research Group:** Analytical, curious speech patterns with technical terminology  
- **Expedition Group:** Confident, experienced voices with survival awareness

**Animation Considerations:** NPCs should have idle animations reflecting their specializations (Elena tending plants, Kane checking defenses, Kim analyzing data, Shadow scanning for threats).

**Expansion Potential:** Each group can support additional character archetypes while maintaining thematic consistency and mechanical balance.
