## **CORE MECHANICS INTEGRATION**

### **Day/Night Cycle as Narrative Driver**
- **Preparation Phase** (Day): Building, merging, positioning
- **Combat Phase** (Night): Waves, explosions, desperate defenses  
- **Eternal Loop**: Each cycle builds tension and stakes

### **The 6 Mechanics Woven Into Story:**

1. **Day/Night Cycle** = The eternal struggle between hope and despair
2. **Merge Mechanics** = Evolution through unity and sacrifice  
3. **Soldier Placement** = Personal stakes and human connection
4. **Landmines** = Turning the battlefield into your weapon
5. **Zombie Waves** = The growing darkness that tests your resolve
6. **Airstrikes** = Divine intervention when all seems lost

---

## **EMOTIONAL FLOW**
1. **Vigilance** (Day/Night cycles create rhythm)
2. **Threat** (Zombie waves establish stakes)  
3. **Hope** (Building and merging show progress)
4. **Connection** (Soldiers as people, not units)
5. **Strategy** (Landmines show tactical depth)
6. **Desperation** (When defenses fail)
7. **Salvation** (Airstrikes as last resort)
8. **Resolve** (The eternal cycle continues)

---

## **TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS**

### **Timing & Pacing**
- **Duration:** 60-75 seconds for focused impact
- **Day/Night Transitions:** 3-4 second cycles to establish rhythm
- **Merge Animations:** 2-3 seconds to show transformation clearly
- **Combat Sequences:** Quick cuts building tension
- **Airstrike Moment: 4-5 seconds for maximum dramatic impact

### **Visual Style**
- **Color Palette:** Warm golds (day) vs. cold blues (night)
- **Lighting:** Dynamic time-of-day system driving emotional tone
- **Effects:** Smooth merging, explosive combat, cinematic airstrikes
- **UI Elements:** Minimal, focusing on core mechanics only

### **Core Mechanics Showcase Priority:**
1. **Day/Night Cycle** - Primary narrative driver
2. **Zombie Waves** - Primary threat visualization  
3. **Merge System** - Key strategic mechanic
4. **Soldier Placement** - Tactical positioning
5. **Landmines** - Battlefield control
6. **Airstrikes** - Emergency response system
