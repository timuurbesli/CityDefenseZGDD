## **CORE MECHANICS INTEGRATION**

### **Day/Night Cycle as Narrative Driver**
- **Preparation Phase** (Day): Building, merging, positioning
- **Combat Phase** (Night): Waves, explosions, desperate defenses  
- **Eternal Loop**: Each cycle builds tension and stakes

### **The 6 Mechanics Woven Into Story:**

1. **Day/Night Cycle** = The eternal struggle between hope and despair
2. **Merge Mechanics** = Evolution through unity and sacrifice  
3. **Soldier Placement** = Personal stakes and human connection
4. **Landmines** = Turning the battlefield into your weapon
5. **Zombie Waves** = The growing darkness that tests your resolve
6. **Airstrikes** = Divine intervention when all seems lost

---

## **EMOTIONAL FLOW**
1. **Vigilance** (Day/Night cycles create rhythm)
2. **Threat** (Zombie waves establish stakes)  
3. **Hope** (Building and merging show progress)
4. **Connection** (Soldiers as people, not units)
5. **Strategy** (Landmines show tactical depth)
6. **Desperation** (When defenses fail)
7. **Salvation** (Airstrikes as last resort)
8. **Resolve** (The eternal cycle continues)
