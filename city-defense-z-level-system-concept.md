# City Defense Z - Level System (Short Version)

## Core Concept
Infinite-scaling wave survival with intelligent zombie formations. Each night lasts 60 seconds - survive or eliminate all zombies to progress. Players choose when to end their run at any day.

## Zombie Progression (Configurable)
- **Day 1**: Normal zombies only
- **Configurable Day**: Add runners (85% normal, 15% runner)  
- **Later Day**: Add exploders (70% normal, 20% runner, 10% exploder)
- **End Game**: Full roster (50% normal, 30% runner, 20% exploder)

## Boss Schedule (Configurable)
- **First Boss Day**: Big Exploding Zombie (massive health, death explosion)
- **Second Boss Day**: Rock Thrower (long-range attacks, forces repositioning)
- **Third Boss Day**: Toxic Spitter (poison zones, area denial)
- **Late Game**: Random boss encounters increase

## Formation System (Key Innovation)
Changes spawn order and timing to create different tactical challenges:

**Easy Formations**
- Runners spawn first → die without backup
- All types spawn randomly → no coordination

**Hard Formations**  
- Normals spawn first, runners 10 seconds later → runners use normals as shields
- Exploders spawn first → dangerous to kill front line
- Boss spawns with escort → must clear protection first

## Difficulty Scaling
- **Stats**: Health, speed, and damage increase over time
- **Numbers**: More zombies, faster spawn rates, multiple waves
- **Formations**: Simple early → complex mixed strategies late game
- **Key Spikes**: Configurable days mark major difficulty jumps

## Infinite Scaling
After hand-crafted content ends, mathematical curves handle scaling:
- Exponential stat growth
- Rotating advanced formation patterns  
- Frequent boss encounters
- Multiple simultaneous waves

## Strategic Depth
Players must:
- Recognize incoming formation types
- Adapt defenses mid-wave
- Manage resources for different threats
- Master timing of defensive actions

This transforms simple wave survival into deep tactical gameplay through intelligent enemy AI and infinite progression.
