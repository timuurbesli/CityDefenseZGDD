## Slide 3: Revolutionary Features

### üè∞ YOUR BASE, YOUR PEOPLE, YOUR STORY

The heart of City Defense Z lies in its expandable NPC ecosystem. Choose from **four distinct specialist groups**‚ÄîFarm experts who double your crop yields, Military veterans who boost combat effectiveness by 50%, Research scientists who accelerate technological progress, and Expedition specialists who increase survival rates and rare resource discovery.

But these aren't just stat bonuses‚Äîthey're living characters. Walk around your base and you'll see your chosen specialists stationed at their posts. Click on Dr. Sarah Chen, and her voice crackles through your walkie-talkie with authentic static: *"My research shows a 23% efficiency increase if we modify the ammunition formula."*

‚Ä¢ **üåæ Farm Group:** +100% crop harvest rate, food production bonuses

Unlike mindless wave-based games, every map tells a story with clear objectives. Take Map 1‚Äîthe Desert Outpost. Your mission isn't just "survive indefinitely." It's *"We have to repair our planes to leave, but it will take 50 days."* When your engineer finally radios in‚Äî*"The plane is ready. We can leave whenever you want"*‚Äîyou feel genuine accomplishment.
