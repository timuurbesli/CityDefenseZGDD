*[GIF: Burning zombies forming "10 DAYS LEFT" text with dramatic flames]*

**The countdown begins now.**

## ‚öîÔ∏è DAY 10: YOUR ARMY AWAITS

**They started as ordinary people. Citizens. Neighbors. Friends.**

Now they stand at the walls, weapons in hand, ready to face the endless night. But in City Defense Z, your soldiers are more than just defenders ‚Äì they're capable of something extraordinary.

### From Survivors to Legends

*[GIF: Camera panning left to right showing all 5 soldier levels side by side - Level 1 with pistol, Level 2 with shotgun, Level 3 with assault rifle, Level 4 with minigun, Level 5 with flamethrower]*

What if we told you that the frightened civilian clutching a pistol could become something more? That through experience, training, and sheer will to survive, they could transform into an unstoppable force?

Every soldier in your army carries this potential. Through our **merge system**, three become one ‚Äì but that one is something far greater than the sum of its parts.

### The Power of Evolution

*[GIF: Three Level 1 soldiers merging together with dramatic effects, transforming into one Level 2 soldier]*

Watch as your defenders evolve from desperate survivors into tactical specialists. See them grow from simple firearms to devastating weaponry that can turn the tide of any battle.

But the transformation doesn't stop there. Push further, invest deeper, and witness the birth of true legends - warriors whose very presence on the battlefield strikes fear into the undead hordes.

### The Choice is Yours

Will you field an army of many, or forge a few into legends? In City Defense Z, both paths lead to survival - but only one leads to victory.

**Five levels of evolution. Countless strategic possibilities. One ultimate question: How far will you push your soldiers to save humanity?**
