# Commander Voss - Infected Cat Situation Dialogue

## Context
A civilian reports finding an infected cat near the camp that appears to be a zombie but remains cute and non-threatening, unlike typical zombie behavior.

## Commander Voss's Response

**Commander Voss:** *[Radio static clears]* "Copy that, civilian. This is... unusual, to say the least. We've documented zombie behavior patterns for months now, and this doesn't fit any of our established protocols."

*[Pause, considering]*

"Here's what we're going to do: First, maintain visual contact but keep your distance. Second, I want a full description of the cat's condition - any visible wounds, behavioral patterns, signs of aggression. Third, if it approaches the perimeter, we need to know immediately."

*[Professional but slightly intrigued]*

"Animals react differently to the infection than humans do. We've seen cases where smaller creatures develop partial immunity or... modified symptoms. But we can't afford to assume anything is safe until we understand the full picture."

*[Firm but not harsh]*

"Keep it under observation, but don't attempt to interact. If it shows any signs of becoming a threat, you know the protocol. And civilian? Good work bringing this to my attention. In this new world, even the smallest anomalies could be the key to understanding what we're dealing with."

*[Radio crackle]*

"Voss out."

## Alternative Response (More Humorous Tone)

**Commander Voss:** *[Radio static]* "Well, that's a new one for the incident report. A zombie cat that's more interested in being cute than eating brains? The apocalypse just keeps surprising us."

*[Chuckles slightly]*

"Listen, civilian, I appreciate the thoroughness, but let's not get too attached to our new furry friend. We've learned the hard way that the infection doesn't play favorites. Keep it under observation, maintain safe distance, and if it starts showing any of the usual zombie enthusiasm for human flesh, we'll need to take appropriate action."

*[Professional tone returns]*

"Document everything - behavior patterns, any changes in condition, interaction with other animals if any. This could be valuable intel for our research team. But remember, cute or not, we can't let our guard down. Not even for a zombie cat."

*[Radio crackle]*

"Stay vigilant, civilian. Voss out."
