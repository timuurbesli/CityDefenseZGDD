## MAJOR GAMEPLAY SYSTEM OVERHAUL

**Food Consumption System Completely Redesigned**

We've completely overhauled the food system to make it more logical and strategic. Here's what changed and why:

**What We Fixed:**
- **Non-Human Units No Longer Consume Food** - Machines don't need to eat!
- **Strategic Resource Management** - Food now only consumed by actual soldiers
- **Balanced Gameplay** - More strategic decisions about unit deployment
- **Realistic Mechanics** - Turrets, machine guns, and other machines operate independently

**Why This Matters:**
- **Better Strategy** - Focus food on human units that actually need it
- **Resource Efficiency** - No more wasting food on machines
- **Logical Gameplay** - More realistic and intuitive mechanics
- **Enhanced Planning** - Clearer resource allocation decisions
