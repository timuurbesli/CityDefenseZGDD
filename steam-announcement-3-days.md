# City Defense Z - 3 DAYS LEFT: BUILD YOUR SURVIVAL COMMUNITY

**4 specialists. 4 groups. Infinite strategic possibilities.**

*[GIF: NPC selection interface showing character portraits with "3 DAYS LEFT" countdown]*

Only **3 days** remain until the apocalypse begins on **August 26th**. Today, we're revealing the **NPC and Expedition System** - the feature that transforms your base from a lonely outpost into a thriving survival community where every choice matters.

---

## üë• DAY 3: THE NPC & EXPEDITION SYSTEM

**When the world ends, who will you trust with your survival?**

Imagine your base not as a collection of buildings, but as a living community where every specialist you recruit fundamentally changes how you play the game. That's what the NPC and Expedition System delivers - strategic depth wrapped in emotional storytelling.

---

## üéØ THE FOUR SPECIALIST GROUPS

**Each group offers completely different survival strategies**

### üåæ Farm Group - Agricultural Specialists
**Focus: Food production, sustainability, and resource management**

**"Iron" Pete Morrison** - -50% food consumption  
*"Every animal here earns their keep‚Ä¶ Just like the rest of us survivors."*
*Pete's the master of efficiency - your population will eat less while staying just as productive. Perfect for tight resource situations.*

### ‚öîÔ∏è Military Group - Combat Specialists
**Focus: Base defense, tactical superiority, and combat enhancement**

**Captain Alexis "Fortress" Kane** - +20% soldier damage
*"Every wall we build is another day we buy for the people inside. Another day they get to LIVE."*
*Captain Kane turns your soldiers into killing machines. With her leadership, every bullet counts and every zombie dies faster.*

### üî¨ Research Group - Scientific Specialists
**Focus: Technological advancement, meta progression, and efficiency**

**Dr. "Quantum" Kim Nakamura** - +50% research collection
*"The solution to this outbreak isn't in brute force‚Ä¶ It's in understanding the SCIENCE."*
*Dr. Kim accelerates your research like nothing else. Want to unlock advanced tech faster? She's your specialist.*

### üéØ Expedition Group - Exploration Specialists
**Focus: Resource acquisition, survival, and risk mitigation**

**"Compass" Jake Harrison** - +50% expedition speed
*"Navigation isn't about knowing where you are‚Ä¶ It's about knowing where you're going."*
*Jake makes expeditions faster and safer. Time is survival, and Jake buys you more of both.*

---

## üèóÔ∏è LIVING BASE ENVIRONMENT

**Your base becomes a living, breathing community**

**Interactive Base System:**
- NPCs actually walk around your base - you'll see Elena tending to crops, Captain Kane inspecting defenses
- Click on any specialist for unique dialogue that reflects their personality and role
- Every interaction feels authentic with professional voice acting and walkie-talkie static effects
- Your base transforms from a static defense into a dynamic survival community

**Emotional Investment:**
- Each specialist has 6 unique voice lines that reveal their personality and expertise
- The more you interact, the more attached you become - these aren't just stats, they're characters
- When an NPC dies on an expedition, you lose more than just their buffs - you lose a character you've grown to care about
- Your choices create a unique story of survival that's different every time you play

---

## üöÄ EXPEDITION SYSTEM

**Dangerous missions where every choice matters**

**Expedition Types:**
- **Small Expedition** (3 days) - Low risk, Desert Ruins
  *Perfect for beginners or when you need quick resources*
- **Medium Expedition** (4 days) - High risk, Abandoned Suburbs  
  *Balanced risk/reward for experienced players*
- **Large Expedition** (5 days) - High risk, Military Lab Complex
  *High-stakes missions for maximum rewards*

**Strategic Planning:**
- Choose up to 4 specialists for each expedition - every team composition feels different
- The interface shows real-time risk assessment so you know exactly what you're getting into
- Resource costs are transparent - you'll know exactly how much food and ammo you're investing
- Team composition directly affects survival rates and reward quality

**Permanent Consequences:**
- **NPCs can die and never return** - this isn't a game where everyone gets plot armor
- Losing a specialist means losing their unique buffs and capabilities permanently
- The emotional impact is real - you'll feel the loss of characters you've grown attached to
- Dead NPCs can't be replaced immediately, forcing you to adapt your strategy

---

## üéÆ STRATEGIC TEAM COMPOSITIONS

**Proven team combinations for different playstyles**

**Balanced Sustainability** (200 Power):
Pete + Captain Kane + Dr. Kim + Compass Jake
*The perfect all-rounder team. Pete keeps your population fed efficiently, Kane defends your base, Dr. Kim accelerates your research, and Jake ensures fast, safe expeditions. Great for players who want to experience everything the game has to offer.*

**Combat-Focused** (205 Power):
Pete + Captain Kane + Dr. Kim + Compass Jake
*The combat-focused team. Pete reduces food consumption so you can focus on combat, Kane maximizes soldier damage, Dr. Kim provides research support, and Jake ensures reliable expeditions. Perfect for players who prefer aggressive tactics.*

**Research-Focused** (185 Power):
Pete + Captain Kane + Dr. Kim + Compass Jake
*The tech-focused team. Pete and Kane provide the foundation, while Dr. Kim supercharges your research. Jake ensures you can gather resources efficiently. You'll unlock advanced technologies faster than any other team composition.*

**Expedition-Focused** (210 Power):
Pete + Captain Kane + Dr. Kim + Compass Jake

## üé≠ FULLY VOICE ACTED EXPERIENCE

**Every specialist has a unique voice that brings them to life**

**Voice Profiles:**
- **Captain Kane:** Crisp, authoritative military voice - every word carries the weight of command and experience
- **Dr. Kim:** Confident, precise voice with a subtle Japanese accent - you can hear the scientist's passion for discovery
- **Pete:** Deep, gravelly voice with a rural American accent - the voice of someone who's worked the land all their life
- **Compass Jake:** Weathered voice with outdoor experience - he speaks like someone who's spent years navigating the wasteland

*Every voice line is delivered with authentic radio static effects, making you feel like you're really communicating with survivors over walkie-talkies in a post-apocalyptic world.*

---

## üîÑ EXCLUSIVE RECRUITMENT SYSTEM

**Every choice matters - there are no do-overs**

**Recruitment Mechanics:**
- Recruitment opportunities happen on specific days - you'll know when they're coming
- Each encounter presents exactly 2 specialists to choose from - no easy decisions
- You can only pick one specialist per encounter - choose wisely
- Once recruited, specialists stay with you until they potentially die on an expedition

**Strategic Decision Framework:**
- Do you need immediate help (like food production) or are you planning for the long term?
- Are you comfortable with high-risk expeditions or do you prefer safer, slower progress?
- What's your preferred playstyle - aggressive combat, careful planning, or rapid advancement?
- What's your base currently lacking, and how does that influence your choice?

*This system ensures that every playthrough feels different based on your choices. No two players will have the same experience.*

---

## üåÖ What's Next?

You've met the specialists who will build your survival community. You've seen the expeditions that will test their skills. You've heard the voices that will guide you through the apocalypse. But survival requires more than community and communication - it requires the weapons to protect what you've built. Tomorrow, we reveal the arsenal that transforms your specialists into an unstoppable force.

**Stay connected, Survivors...**
