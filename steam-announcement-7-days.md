# City Defense Z - 7 DAYS LEFT: THE POWER WITHIN

**Every defeat makes you stronger...**

*[GIF: Burning zombies forming "7 DAYS LEFT" text with dramatic flames]*

Only **7 days** remain until the zombies break through on **August 26th**. But here's what separates survivors from legends: **the power to grow stronger with every fall**.

In City Defense Z, defeat isn't the end - it's the beginning of your evolution.

## üî¨ DAY 7: THE RESEARCH SYSTEM REVEALED

**When the walls fall and the city burns, what remains?**

Your knowledge. Your progress. Your unbreakable will to become stronger.

### The Phoenix of Progress

*[GIF: Meta upgrade radial skill tree opening and closing, showing the permanent upgrades branching out in a beautiful web of power]*

While other survivors start from scratch with each attempt, you carry something far more valuable: **Research Points**. Every laboratory you build, every expedition you complete, every moment you survive adds to your permanent arsenal of upgrades.

This isn't just progression - this is **evolution**.

### Nine Paths to Mastery (74 Total Upgrades)

**Buildings Enhancement**: Transform your construction RNG from basic 80% Level 1 cards to a master's 30% Level 5 cards. Watch as your city rises with legendary structures from the very first wave.

**Combat Mastery**: Dramatically increase your chances of training higher-level soldiers from the start. Enhanced RNG means more Level 2-5 troops in your recruitment pool, plus weapons that fire faster, reload quicker, and hit harder than anything the old world ever imagined.

**Impenetrable Walls**: Build fortifications with +250% durability that damage when attacked. Let the zombies learn what happens when they touch your defenses.

**Wall Garrison**: Mount permanent Bixi machine guns directly onto your walls. Up to 5 automated heavy weapons on each side provide relentless firepower that never runs out of ammunition and never needs rest.

**Agricultural Revolution**: Harvest crops in days instead of weeks, expand your farms beyond all limits, and feed your city with yields that would make the old world weep with envy.

**Research Acceleration**: Generate Research Points 375% faster and complete discoveries in record time. Knowledge is power, and power is survival.

**Support Networks**: Send expeditions with near-perfect success rates and amplify every NPC's abilities by over 200%. Build alliances that span beyond the grave.

**Phoenix Protocol**: Rise from defeat itself with multiple revival chances per run. Death becomes merely an inconvenience on your path to victory.

**Strategic Flexibility**: Reroll building cards up to 4 times per selection. Never settle for less than perfection in your city's construction.

### Strategic Unlock Patterns

The order you choose matters. Will you rush **Laboratory upgrades** to earn Research Points faster and unlock everything sooner? Or prioritize **Combat upgrades** first to survive longer runs and reach later waves? Maybe boost your **Agricultural economy** to build sustainable long-term growth?

Each path creates a different playstyle:
- **Research Rush**: Fast meta progression, quicker access to powerful upgrades
- **Combat Focus**: Deeper runs, more experience, higher wave completion bonuses  
- **Economy Build**: Sustainable resource generation, steady compound growth

### The Compound Effect

Each upgrade amplifies the others. Enhanced building cards work perfectly with reroll flexibility. Combat improvements synergize with wall fortifications. Laboratory efficiency accelerates every other research path.

**With 74 individual upgrades across 9 specialized trees, this isn't just a game - it's a masterclass in strategic compound growth.**

## üåÖ What's Next?

Your soldiers are trained, your research paths are clear, but survival requires more than strength and knowledge. Tomorrow, we reveal what keeps hope alive when the world has ended.

**Stay vigilant, Survivors...**
