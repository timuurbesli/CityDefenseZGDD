## MAJOR SYSTEM OVERHAUL: NEW MERGE SYSTEM

**The biggest change today - completely redesigned merge mechanics based on your feedback!**

**Old System:** Merging more than 3 soldiers/buildings was broken
**New System:** Smart merge system that works with any number of items!

**How it works:**
- Merge 3 level 1 soldiers/buildings → Get 1 level 2
- Merge 4 level 1 soldiers/buildings → Get 1 level 2 + 1 level 1 (bonus!)
- The more you merge, the better the rewards!

**New Merge Logic:**
- **3 level 1 items** => 1 level 2 item
- **4 level 1 items** => 1 level 2 + 1 level 1 (extra item!)
- **5 level 1 items** => 2 level 2 items
- **6 level 1 items** => 2 level 2 + 1 level 1
- **7 level 1 items** => 1 level 3 item
- **8 level 1 items** => 1 level 3 + 1 level 1
- **9 level 1 items** => 1 level 3 + 1 level 2

**Max Level Merging:**
- **7 level 4 items** => 3 level 5 items
- **8 level 4 items** => 3 level 5 + 1 level 4
- **9 level 4 items** => 3 level 5 + 2 level 4

*This system now works for ALL buildings and soldiers!*

---

## GAME BALANCE IMPROVEMENTS

**Based on your feedback about game difficulty and progression:**

**Economy Adjustments:**
- Wall prices reduced
- Soldier placement cost: 5 ammo → 3 ammo

**Combat Balance:**
- Machine guns nerfed (damage and fire rate reduced)
- All soldier stats balanced and buffed
- Runner zombies on day 15 reduced (they were too dangerous!)

**Time Management:**
- Day duration extended (more preparation time!)
- Night duration shortened
- Day difficulty scaling balanced across all 4 maps

**Survival Mechanics:**
- Hunger debuff: 50% → 20% (less punishing)

---

## UI/UX ENHANCEMENTS

**Your requests for better user experience have been implemented:**

**Resource Collection:**
- **Single-click collection** for same building types
- **Hold-to-collect** functionality
- Now when you click on Ammunition building, ALL ammunition buildings collect automatically!

**Placement Improvements:**

- Better focus and cleaner interface
