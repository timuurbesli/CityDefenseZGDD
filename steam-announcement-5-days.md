## üßü DAY 5: THE ZOMBIE THREAT REVEALED

**When the dead rise, they don't all rise the same...**

Every zombie in City Defense Z serves a tactical purpose. Every encounter demands a different response. Every wave composition forces you to adapt or die.

### The Trinity of Terror

*[GIF: Epic night defense battle featuring all three boss zombies attacking simultaneously]*

City Defense Z features **3 distinct zombie types**, each requiring specific counter-strategies that will determine whether your city stands or falls.

---

## üö∂ THE HORDE: Normal Zombies

**The relentless majority that never stops coming**

### The Foundation of Fear
- **5+ unique visual models** ensure every horde feels fresh and terrifying
- **Standard speed and durability** - predictable but dangerous in numbers
- **The constant pressure** that tests your resource management
- **Perfect training targets** for testing your basic defensive setups

**Strategy:** Your bread-and-butter soldiers handle them efficiently, but their sheer numbers will overwhelm unprepared defenses. They're the foundation every other strategy builds upon.

---

## üèÉ THE SPRINTERS: Runner Zombies

**First to arrive, first to break your lines**

### Speed Kills
- **High-speed movement** gets them to your walls before anything else
- **Running animations** make them instantly recognizable in the chaos
- **First contact specialists** - they engage your defenses before the main horde arrives
- **Priority targets** that draw critical early firepower

**Counter-Strategy:** Machine Gun (Bixi) units excel against fast targets. Use Defense Walls to create chokepoints and Landmines for area denial. Let them come to you - then cut them down.

---

## üí• THE BOMBS: Exploding Zombies

**Seek and destroy specialists with devastating explosive capability**

### Living Suicide Bombers
- **Unique larger model** with distinct texture - you'll know them when you see them
- **High HP** requires sustained fire to eliminate
- **Active explosion seeking** - they run toward your units to detonate on contact
- **Death explosion backup** - if killed before reaching target, they still explode with smaller radius
- **Double threat** that demands immediate attention

**Counter-Strategy:** Eliminate them before they reach your units! Long-range weapons are essential. Even if you kill them, stay clear of the death explosion. They're like mini-Banger bosses with less health and smaller blast radius.

---

## üëπ THE APEX PREDATORS: Boss Zombies

**Three legendary threats that will test everything you've learned**

When regular zombies aren't enough, the apocalypse sends its champions. Each boss requires complete defensive coordination and specialized strategies to defeat.

### üóø LEVEL 1 BOSS: Stonefist
**Dual-threat rock thrower with devastating melee capability**



**The Boulder Barrage Nightmare:**
- **Long-range rock throwing** threatens your back-line units
- **Devastating melee strikes** destroy anything that gets close
- **Massive health pool** requires sustained assault from multiple sources
- **Dual-range threat** forces you to defend at every distance simultaneously

**Survival Strategy:** Combine long-range heavy weapons with close-combat soldiers. Use walls to block rock throws while maintaining units at multiple ranges. No single strategy works - you need everything.

---

### üß® LEVEL 2 BOSS: Banger
**Melee combat specialist with toxic death explosion**



**The Ultimate Sacrifice Play:**
- **Devastating close-range attacks** tear through frontline defenses
- **Enormous health pool** extends battle duration to breaking point
- **Toxic explosion on death** creates massive AoE damage zone
- **Post-death area denial** threatens your entire defensive position

**Survival Strategy:** Long-range elimination is mandatory. Rocket Launchers and Mortars are essential. Prepare to evacuate the area before the boss dies. Accept the loss of forward positions to ensure survival.

---

### ‚ò¢Ô∏è LEVEL 3 BOSS: Toxicz
**Long-range toxic specialist with battlefield control mastery**



**The Battlefield Dominator:**
- **Long-range toxic projectiles** with devastating damage
- **Area denial zones** restrict unit movement and positioning
- **Colossal health pool** creates the ultimate endurance challenge
- **Complete battlefield control** - nowhere is safe

**Survival Strategy:** Constant unit repositioning required. Maximum weapons upgrades essential. Multiple Tower networks for sustained damage. Keep Revive capabilities ready as final insurance. This is the ultimate test.

---

## üåä THE ESCALATING THREAT

### Wave Evolution
**Early Days:** Normal + Runner Zombies - *Learn the basics*
**Mid Game:** Add Exploding Zombies - *Adapt your strategy*  
**Late Game:** All types + Bosses - *Survive the ultimate challenge*

### The Growing Challenge
Later waves combine all zombie types with boss encounters:
- **Normal Zombies** provide relentless pressure
- **Runner Zombies** force rapid response
- **Exploding Zombies** demand long-range solutions
- **Boss encounters** require everything working together

**Every wave gets more dangerous. Every day tests your limits.**

---

## üåÖ What's Next?

You know your enemies. You understand their threats. But survival requires more than knowledge - it requires the tools to act on that knowledge. Tomorrow, we reveal the arsenal that turns tactics into victory.

**Stay tactical, Survivors...**
