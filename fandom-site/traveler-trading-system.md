# Traveler Trading System

The '''Traveler Trading System''' allows players to exchange resources through a mysterious traveling merchant who appears randomly throughout the game.

== How It Works ==

=== Timing ===
* Traveler appears '''randomly every ~10 days''' (could be day 3, day 6, etc.)
* Arrives at '''morning dawn''' and leaves when you '''end the day'''
* You have the '''entire day''' to decide whether to trade

=== Interface ===
* Golden wagon button appears in top-right corner when available
* Click to open trading modal with:
** Current resource display
** Three random trade options as cards
** "MAKE THIS TRADE" or "INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES" buttons

== UI/UX Mockup ==

== Mechanics ==

* Three '''random trades''' are offered each visit
* You can only make '''one trade per visit'''
* Must have sufficient resources to complete trade

== Trading Strategies ==

=== Research Point Rush ===
'''Sacrifice current run for long-term meta progression'''

* '''Concept''': Trade away [[File:Resource_Icon.png|32px]] Resources and [[File:Ammunition_Icon.png|32px]] Ammunition for [[File:Research_Icon.png|32px]] Research Points
* '''Goal''': Accept run failure to maximize permanent upgrades
* '''Benefits''': Start future runs with upgraded buildings, better soldiers, enhanced economy
* '''When to Use''': Early in progression when base upgrades provide massive value
* '''Risk''': Short-term setbacks for long-term dominance

=== Current Run Investment ===
'''Trade research points to boost immediate survival chances'''

* '''Concept''': Convert [[File:Research_Icon.png|32px]] Research Points into critical resources needed now
* '''Goal''': Strengthen current run to potentially earn '''more''' research points from survival milestones
* '''Benefits''': Survive longer waves, defeat more bosses, complete map objectives
* '''When to Use''': When close to major milestones or facing difficult waves
* '''Calculation''': Research points spent < Research points potentially gained from extended survival

=== Resource Balancing ===
'''Use surplus resources to address shortages'''

* '''Ammunition Surplus''': Trade [[File:Ammunition_Icon.png|32px]] → [[File:Resource_Icon.png|32px]] for building expansion
* '''Resource Overflow''': Trade [[File:Resource_Icon.png|32px]] → [[File:Food_Icon.png|32px]] to prevent '''HUNGER penalties'''
* '''Food Abundance''': Trade [[File:Food_Icon.png|32px]] → [[File:Ammunition_Icon.png|32px]] for enhanced military capacity
* '''Strategic Timing''': Balance resources before night phase or major construction projects

=== Emergency Trades ===
'''Crisis response through resource conversion'''

* '''Pre-Wave Preparation''': Convert any excess to [[File:Ammunition_Icon.png|32px]] before difficult nights
* '''Population Crisis''': Trade for [[File:Food_Icon.png|32px]] to avoid combat effectiveness penalties
* '''Building Shortage''': Convert to [[File:Resource_Icon.png|32px]] for essential infrastructure cards
* '''Last Resort''': Any available trade can prevent total failure

=== Advanced Techniques ===

'''Market Timing'''
* Plan major resource expenditures around traveler visit days
* Use traveler availability to enable risky strategies

'''Opportunity Cost Analysis'''
* Compare trade value to natural resource generation
* Consider time value - immediate resources vs waiting for production
* Factor in urgency of current strategic needs

'''Combo Strategies'''
* Combine traveler visits with [[NPC and Expedition System|expedition planning]]
* Coordinate trades with [[Meta Progression (Research System)|research upgrade purchases]]
* Time trades around major [[Buildings#Strategic Building Patterns|building merge projects]]
