# World Events System

The '''World Events System''' in City Defense Z creates immersive apocalyptic atmosphere through a '''Dual NPC Announcement System''' that separates mission-critical information from world atmosphere, allowing players to receive tactical updates while experiencing the broader global collapse.

== Core Concept Overview ==

'''Dual NPC Announcement System''': Two distinct NPCs handling different types of information to create layered narrative depth and tactical awareness.

'''Key Philosophy''': Separate mission-critical information from world atmosphere, allowing players to receive tactical updates while experiencing the broader apocalyptic collapse.

=== Map 1: Nevada Emergency Base (Days 1-50) ===
''Starting World Population: 40% Human''

==== [[File:Base_Commander_Icon.png|32px]] Base Commander Updates (Mission Focus) ====

* '''Day -1 (Mission Briefing)''':
** '''Part 1''': ''"Listen up, team. [Deep breath] Look around you... this isn't where any of us thought we'd be three months ago. Our families, our friends, our entire world... gone."''
** '''Part 2''': ''"But here we are, standing in the middle of hell itself, and somehow we're still breathing. That means something. Our final aim? Find a cure to this godforsaken nightmare that's swallowed our planet whole. But Jesus Christ, where do we even start? We don't have scientists - they're all dead or turned. We don't have resources - everything's ash and ruin. Hell, we don't even have a functioning plane!!! [Bitter laugh]"''
** '''Part 3''': ''"But you know what? I've seen impossible things in my 20 years of service. I've seen miracles born from desperation. We will probably fail... statistically, we're already dead. But if there's even a one-percent chance that we can save what's left of humanity, then by God, we take that chance!"''
** '''Part 4''': ''"So buckle up, warriors. We're going to tackle this nightmare one problem at a time. Our first mountain to climb? Getting this bird in the air. 50 days of pure hell to fix what's broken. Hold this position like your children's lives depend on it... because they do."''

* '''Day 12''': ''"Attention team. Plane repair is progressing steadily. Mechanics estimate 38 days remaining. Stay focused on perimeter defense."''
* '''Day 25''': ''"Halfway point reached on repairs. 25 days remaining. Maintain current defensive posture."''
* '''Day 45''': ''"Final phase. Fuel systems online, engines testing. 5 days to operational status."''
* '''Day 50''': ''"Aircraft is ready for departure. Awaiting your signal to proceed to next objective."''

==== [[File:News_Speaker_Icon.png|32px]] World News Speaker Broadcasts (Apocalyptic Atmosphere) ====
* '''Day 1''': ''[Shaking voice] "Good morning... if anyone's still listening... Current estimates show 40% of global population remains human. We're... we're the minority now, folks."''
* '''Day 8''': ''[Panicked] "FAST ONES! THEY'RE RUNNING NOW! Not all of them shuffle anymore, folks... some of these things... Jesus... they sprint like Olympic athletes!"''
* '''Day 12''': ''[Hopeful but desperate] "Wait... wait, I'm getting reports... rumors of a powerful group out there... survivors who might... who might actually be working on a cure! God, I hope it's true... God help you survivors, we have no hope from governments anymore... it's all on your hands now!"''
* '''Day 15''': ''[Heavy breathing] "Los Angeles has gone dark... completely dark. No signals from the West Coast for 72 hours. How many more cities...?"''
* '''Day 18''': ''[Static crackling] "BREAKING NEWS! Oh Christ... explosive infected reported in Nevada sector! They're... they're blowing themselves up! What kind of nightmare...!"''
* '''Day 25''': ''[Voice breaking] "Tokyo... Sydney... London... all reporting armored variants. The virus is... it's making them stronger. Smarter. God help us all."''
* '''Day 35''': ''[Exhausted] "Population update... we're down to... oh God... 32% human survivors globally. We're losing this war..."''
* '''Day 42''': ''[Desperate] "Washington D.C. has fallen. The Pentagon went silent 6 hours ago. If the government is gone... who's going to save us?!"''

=== Map 2: Urban Abandoned City (Days 1-75) ===
''Starting World Population: 25% Human''

==== [[File:Base_Commander_Icon.png|32px]] Base Commander Updates (Mission Focus) ====

* '''Day -1 (Mission Briefing)''':
** '''Part 1''': ''"Alright team, we made it out of Nevada... but look around us. This city was home to 2 million people just months ago. Now it's a graveyard with buildings for tombstones. The silence here... it's not peaceful. It's the silence of extinction."''
** '''Part 2''': ''"But we didn't come here to mourn. Intelligence suggests this city was a major medical research hub - three major hospitals, two pharmaceutical companies, and a CDC research station. Somewhere in these ruins are survivors with the knowledge we need. Scientists who understand this virus better than anyone still breathing."''
** '''Part 3''': ''"I won't lie to you - 75 days in urban warfare conditions against an enemy that knows every alley, every building, every shadow. The infected here have had months to learn this terrain. They've adapted. But so have we. We're not the same desperate survivors who crashed in the desert."''
** '''Part 4''': ''"Our mission is clear: find Dr. Sarah Chen and any surviving researchers, recover critical data about the outbreak, and extract with the intelligence we need. 75 days to search every hospital, every lab, every shelter. The cure starts here, people. Make those 75 days count."''

* '''Day 5''': ''"Team, urban terrain provides cover advantages but complicates sight lines. Adjust formations accordingly."''
* '''Day 20''': ''"Medical district secured. Dr. Chen recovered with critical research data. Good work."''
* '''Day 50''': ''"Dr. Chen's analysis confirms source location. We have our next objective."''
* '''Day 70''': ''"Research data acquisition complete. Prepare for extraction to industrial sector."''

==== [[File:News_Speaker_Icon.png|32px]] World News Speaker Broadcasts (Apocalyptic Atmosphere) ====
* '''Day 1''': ''[Shaking voice] "Day 75 of the outbreak... global human population down to 25%... we're not just losing... we're being exterminated."''
* '''Day 10''': ''[Sobbing intermittently] "My family... my beautiful family... New York is overrun. Central Park is... is a feeding ground now..."''
* '''Day 18''': ''[Screaming in background] "THEY'RE IN THE BUILDING! THEY'RE IN THE BUILDING! Oh God, they learned to climb! How are they climbing?!"''
* '''Day 22''': ''[Desperate hope] "That group I mentioned... the ones working on something... there are new reports... they're still alive! Still fighting! Please God, let them succeed where everyone else has failed..."''
* '''Day 28''': ''[Whispering] "Beijing fell yesterday. 1.4 billion people... gone in 3 days. The Chinese army couldn't... nobody can stop this."''
* '''Day 40''': ''[Hysterical laughter] "Population update! 18% human survivors! We're an endangered species now! Maybe we deserve this... maybe..."''
* '''Day 55''': ''[Technical interference] "Zzzt--Russia launched the nukes--zzt--Moscow is gone--zzzt--better dead than infected--zzt"''
* '''Day 68''': ''[Barely audible] "Antarctica... the research station... went silent today. Even the penguins... oh God, even the penguins are turning..."''

''Starting World Population: 15% Human''

==== [[File:Base_Commander_Icon.png|32px]] Base Commander Updates (Mission Focus) ====

* '''Day -1 (Mission Briefing)''':
** '''Part 1''': ''"Look at what we've accomplished, team. Dr. Chen is alive. We have the research data. We know where the main laboratory is located. For the first time since this nightmare began, we have real hope. But hope without preparation is just wishful thinking."''
** '''Part 2''': ''"The target laboratory is completely overrun - we're talking about a Category 5 infestation with supply lines cut for months. We can't just rush in there. This industrial complex... it's perfect. Military-grade infrastructure, strategic positioning, existing supply networks we can restore."''
** '''Part 3''': ''"90 days, people. 90 days to transform this facility into a forward operating base that can support the final mission. We need secure supply routes, fortified positions, equipment caches, and evacuation protocols. The laboratory assault will be our most dangerous operation yet."''
** '''Part 4''': ''"Dr. Chen's data shows us exactly what we're up against in that laboratory. Concentrated infected populations, evolved variants, and facility lockdown protocols that work against us. But with 90 days of preparation from this FOB, we'll hit that lab ready for anything. This is our staging ground for humanity's last stand."''

* '''Day 15''': ''"Industrial complex assessment complete. 75 days required for forward operating base establishment."''
* '''Day 45''': ''"Halfway point. FOB construction ahead of schedule. Maintain security protocols."''
* '''Day 75''': ''"Perimeter secured. Laboratory assault preparations authorized. Final mission phase approved."''
* '''Day 85''': ''"All systems operational. Laboratory mission commences in 5 days."''

==== [[File:News_Speaker_Icon.png|32px]] World News Speaker Broadcasts (Apocalyptic Atmosphere) ====
* '''Day 1''': ''[Mechanical voice, clearly breaking down] "15% human... 15%... we're not a species anymore... we're a curiosity..."''
* '''Day 12''': ''[Screaming] "THE POPE IS DEAD! VATICAN CITY OVERRUN! IF GOD WON'T SAVE THE POPE, WHO WILL HE SAVE?!"''
* '''Day 20''': ''[Mumbling] "Africa... the entire continent... 3 weeks... cradle of humanity becomes its graveyard..."''
* '''Day 25''': ''[Sudden clarity through madness] "The group... the survivors I talked about... they're still out there... still working... it's been months now... they're our only hope... our only... [trails off into mumbling]"''
* '''Day 30''': ''[Static-filled] "Military retreat from all positions... NATO dissolved... nobody's in charge... nobody's coming to help..."''
* '''Day 45''': ''[Praying continuously] "Our father who art in heaven... hallowed be thy name... the kingdom is gone... the kingdom is dead..."''
* '''Day 58''': ''[Mad laughter] "12% now! We broke double digits! Should we celebrate? Should we throw a party for the last humans on Earth?!"''
* '''Day 70''': ''[Whispering secrets] "I know where the bunkers are... I know where the rich people hid... but the locks... they lock from the outside now..."''
* '''Day 82''': ''[Complete breakdown] "My wife's voice... I hear my wife's voice calling from outside... but she died three months ago... but she sounds so real..."''

=== Map 4: Laboratory Final Mission (Days 1-100) ===
''Starting World Population: 8% Human''

==== [[File:Base_Commander_Icon.png|32px]] Base Commander Updates (Mission Focus) ====

* '''Day -1 (Mission Briefing)''':
** '''Part 1''': ''"We're here. After everything we've been through - the desert, the city, the industrial complex - we're finally here. This laboratory... it holds the key to everything. Dr. Chen has confirmed it: this facility has the equipment, the samples, the genetic sequencing capability to synthesize a working vaccine."''
** '''Part 2''': ''"100 days. That's what it will take to run the synthesis, test the formulation, and produce enough vaccine for global deployment. 100 days while the world dies around us. Look at the numbers - we're down to 8% human population. We're not just fighting for survival anymore... we're fighting for the continuation of our species."''
** '''Part 3''': ''"This facility is going to be the most hostile environment we've ever faced. Every infected in a 50-mile radius will be drawn here. The virus... it's like it knows what we're trying to do. But we've come too far to fail now. Every person who died getting us here, every sacrifice made, every impossible moment we've survived - it all leads to this."''
** '''Part 4''': ''"100 days to save humanity. No pressure, right? [Grim smile] But if anyone can do this, it's us. We've been through hell and kept fighting. Dr. Chen has the knowledge, we have the will, and this laboratory has the tools. The vaccine is within our grasp. Let's make these 100 days count for everyone we've lost... and everyone still out there waiting for us to succeed."''

* '''Day 25''': ''"Vaccine development 25% complete. 75 days remaining for full synthesis. Hold all positions."''
* '''Day 50''': ''"Halfway point. Vaccine synthesis shows promising results. Maintain laboratory security at all costs."''
* '''Day 75''': ''"Final phase vaccine production initiated. 25 days to completion. This is our last chance."''
* '''Day 90''': ''"10 days remaining. All systems operational. Success depends on you."''
* '''Day 100''': ''"Vaccine synthesis complete. Deployment authorized. Mission accomplished."''

==== [[File:News_Speaker_Icon.png|32px]] World News Speaker Broadcasts (Apocalyptic Atmosphere) ====
* '''Day 1''': ''[Barely human voice] "8%... eight percent of humanity remains... we're fossils in the making..."''
* '''Day 8''': ''[Completely unhinged] "I ATE MY DOG YESTERDAY! CANNED FOOD RAN OUT! SPOT TASTED LIKE CHICKEN! LIKE CHICKEN!"''
* '''Day 15''': ''[Sudden clarity, then madness] "Australia is gone. The entire continent. 25 million people... and now it's just... quiet. So quiet. WHY IS IT SO QUIET?!"''
* '''Day 25''': ''[Multiple voices - clearly talking to hallucinations] "Hello, mother... yes, I know I should eat vegetables... but the vegetables are screaming now, mother..."''
* '''Day 35''': ''[Robotic recitation] "Population: 6%. Temperature: 72 degrees. Weather: apocalyptic. Chance of survival: pray to whatever gods you have left."''
* '''Day 50''': ''[Singing nursery rhymes] "Ring around the rosie... pocket full of zombies... ashes, ashes... we all fall down... we all fall down..."''
* '''Day 65''': ''[Sudden panic] "THEY'RE LEARNING TO USE TOOLS! I SAW ONE OPENING A DOOR! THEY'RE SOLVING PUZZLES! WHAT'S NEXT, CALCULUS?!"''
* '''Day 80''': ''[Final coherent moment] "5% left... if anyone's still listening... 5% of 8 billion... that's 400 million souls... maybe that's enough... maybe..."''
* '''Day 90''': ''[Whisper] "I can see them from my window... thousands of them... just standing there... waiting... like they know something we don't..."''
* '''Day 95''': ''[Static-filled] "Signal fading--zzzt--generator failing--zzzt--if this is the last broadcast--zzzt--tell my story--zzzt"''
* '''Day 100''' ('''Vaccine Success'''): ''[Long silence, then barely audible] "Something's... something's happening... they're... they're falling... is this... is this real...?"''
* '''Day 100''' ('''Vaccine Failure'''): ''[Static-filled whisper] "Signal... failing... generator... dying... if anyone... anyone is still... [signal cuts to static]"''
