# World Events System

The '''World Events System''' in City Defense Z creates immersive apocalyptic atmosphere through a '''Dual NPC Announcement System''' that separates mission-critical information from world atmosphere, allowing players to receive tactical updates while experiencing the broader global collapse.

== Core Concept Overview ==

'''Dual NPC Announcement System''': Two distinct NPCs handling different types of information to create layered narrative depth and tactical awareness.

'''Key Philosophy''': Separate mission-critical information from world atmosphere, allowing players to receive tactical updates while experiencing the broader apocalyptic collapse.

''Starting World Population: 40% Human''

==== [[File:Base_Commander_Icon.png|32px]] Base Commander Updates (Mission Focus) ====

* '''Day 1''': ''"Welcome, Commander. I'm Voss — your right hand in this mess. You call the shots, and I'll make sure the city hears them loud and clear. I'll keep you posted on repairs, defenses, and any trouble that dares crawl near our gates. Together, we'll drag this world out of the fire — I believe that."''

* '''Day 1''': ''"Listen up, team. Look around you… this isn't where any of us thought we'd be three months ago. Our homes? Ash. Our leaders? Gone. The world? Unrecognizable."''

* '''Day 1''': ''"But we're still here. And that means one thing — we fight. Not just to survive, but to matter. To do something in the ruins. Our mission is insane — no intel, no scientists, no support. Just us… and a broken damn plane we have to rebuild before we're overrun."''

* '''Day 1''': ''"We will suffer. We might fail. But if there's even a chance we can end this plague — even a sliver — then we do what soldiers do best: we hold the line and we make it count."''

* '''Day 12''': ''"Attention team. Plane repair is progressing steadily. Mechanics estimate 38 days remaining. Stay focused on perimeter defense."''
* '''Day 25''': ''"Halfway point reached on repairs. 25 days remaining. Maintain current defensive posture."''
* '''Day 45''': ''"Final phase. Fuel systems online, engines testing. 5 days to operational status."''
* '''Day 50''': ''"Aircraft is ready for departure. Awaiting your signal to proceed to next objective."''

* '''Day 1''': ''"Hello… w-welcome, survivors. I'm still here, somehow. I'll be trying to bring you the latest from what's left of the world after this damn zombie virus. But uh… spoiler alert — there aren't any good news."''
* '''Day 12''': ''[Hopeful but desperate] "Wait... wait, I'm getting reports... rumors of a powerful group out there... survivors who might... who might actually be working on a cure! God, I hope it's true... God help you survivors, we have no hope from governments anymore... it's all on your hands now!"''
* '''Day 15''': ''[Heavy breathing] "Los Angeles has gone dark... completely dark. No signals from the West Coast for 72 hours. How many more cities...?"''
* '''Day 25''': ''[Voice breaking] "Tokyo... Sydney... London... all reporting armored variants. The virus is... it's making them stronger. Smarter. God help us all."''
* '''Day 35''': ''[Exhausted] "Population update... we're down to... oh God... 32% human survivors globally. We're losing this war..."''
* '''Day 42''': ''[Desperate] "Washington D.C. has fallen. The Pentagon went silent 6 hours ago. If the government is gone... who's going to save us?!"''
