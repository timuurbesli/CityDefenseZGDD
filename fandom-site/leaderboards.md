# Leaderboards

The '''Steam Leaderboards System''' in City Defense Z tracks survival records across all maps. Compete globally by surviving as many days as possible in each unique environment.

== Leaderboard System ==

=== How It Works ===
* '''Days Survived''': Your ranking is based purely on how long you survive
* '''Map-Specific Rankings''': Each map has its own separate leaderboard
* '''Global Competition''': Compare your performance with players worldwide
* '''Personal Records''': Track your best survival time on each map
