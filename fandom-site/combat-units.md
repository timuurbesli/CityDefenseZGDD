# Combat Units

The '''Combat Units System''' in City Defense Z provides diverse tactical options for defending your base against zombie hordes. Success requires strategic deployment of '''combat units''', '''defensive structures''', '''airstrikes''', and '''placeable walls''' to create layered defense systems that can withstand increasingly challenging waves.

== Combat Philosophy ==

City Defense Z's combat system rewards '''tactical diversity''' and '''strategic positioning''':
* '''Layered Defense''': Combine multiple defensive systems for maximum effectiveness
* '''Resource Management''': Balance ammunition costs with defensive needs
* '''Adaptive Strategy''': Adjust military composition based on enemy threats
* '''Terrain Control''': Use walls and structures to channel enemy movement
