# Map Progression

The '''Map Progression System''' in City Defense Z provides progressive challenges through diverse battlefield settings, each with unique tactical requirements and narrative significance. Success requires adapting defensive strategies to environmental constraints while progressing through an interconnected story campaign.

== Map Philosophy ==

City Defense Z's map system rewards '''strategic adaptation''' and '''narrative progression''':
* '''Progressive Challenge''': Each map increases survival duration and tactical complexity
* '''Environmental Adaptation''': Different terrains require adjusted defensive strategies
* '''Story Integration''': Maps reflect narrative context through environmental design
* '''Tactical Variety''': Unique environmental features create distinct gameplay experiences

== Map Progression System ==

=== Campaign Overview ===
'''Linear progression through interconnected survival scenarios'''

{| class="wikitable"
! Map !! Unlock Requirement !! Survival Objective !! Environment Theme !! Narrative Context
|-
| '''1. Nevada''' || Available at start || 50 days || Desert emergency landing site || Plane repair survival scenario
|-
| '''2. Urban''' || Complete Map 1 (50 days) || 75 days || Abandoned city setting || Story-specific scenario
|-
| '''3. Industrial''' || Complete Map 2 (75 days) || TBD days || Industrial/military complex || Story-specific scenario
|-
| '''4. Laboratory''' || Complete Map 3 || 100 days || Research facility/medical complex || Zombie vaccine development
|}

==== Progression Mechanics ====
* '''Sequential Unlock''': Maps unlock only after completing previous map's survival objective
* '''Escalating Duration''': Survival requirements increase with each map
* '''Story Continuity''': Each map continues the overarching narrative
* '''Tactical Evolution''': Environmental challenges become more complex
* '''Infinite Play Option''': After completing mission objectives, players can choose to continue indefinitely on any map

==== Environmental Specifications ====
{| class="wikitable"
! Attribute !! Value !! Tactical Impact
|-
| '''Terrain Type''' || Research Facility/Medical Complex || Scientific installation
|-
| '''Survival Duration''' || 100 Days || Maximum survival challenge
|}

==== Story Arc ====
'''Mission Objective:''' "We finally found the vaccine against the zombies, but it will take 100 days to produce it. Can we survive that long?"

'''Post-Mission Play:''' Map does not automatically end after 100 days - players can choose to continue indefinitely after vaccine completion

== Environmental Design Elements ==

=== Grid System Integration ===
'''Multi-zone grid system for different gameplay functions'''

==== Zone Types ====
{| class="wikitable"
! Zone Type !! Function !! Visual Design !! Strategic Purpose
|-
| '''Main Grid Zone''' || Building placement || Clear grid overlay || Primary base construction area (see '''[[Buildings]]''' for building details)
|-
| '''Farm Grid Zone''' || Crop collection || Distinct agricultural overlay || Crops automatically grow in grids, players collect them (see '''[[Buildings#Farm System (Default Building)]]''' for farm mechanics)
|-
| '''Defense Grid Zone''' || Military positioning || Defense grid overlay || Area for placing defensive structures and soldiers (see '''[[Combat Units]]''' for unit details)
|}

==== Design Principles ====
* '''Visual Clarity''': Clear distinction between zone types and placement areas
* '''Functional Separation''': Different zones serve specific strategic purposes
* '''Progressive Complexity''': Later maps feature more challenging terrain constraints
