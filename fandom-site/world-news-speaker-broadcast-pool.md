- **No Repetition**: Same broadcast won't trigger twice in succession
- **Context Awareness**: Funny broadcasts slightly more likely during intense gameplay moments

### Voice Acting Considerations
- **Emotional Range**: From desperate panic to hysterical laughter
- **Progressive Breakdown**: News speaker's mental state deteriorates over time
- **Audio Effects**: Static, interference, and voice modulation for authenticity
- **Delivery Timing**: Natural pauses and breathing patterns for realism

### Integration with Game Systems
- **Non-Intrusive**: Broadcasts don't interrupt gameplay
- **Atmospheric Enhancement**: Reinforces the apocalyptic setting
- **Player Engagement**: Provides variety and prevents repetition
