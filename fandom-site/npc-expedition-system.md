# NPC and Expedition System

The '''NPC and Expedition System''' transforms City Defense Z from a static base defense game into a living, breathing survival community. Choose specialists who fundamentally change your playstyle, build emotional connections through interactive dialogue, and send your team on dangerous expeditions for crucial resources.

'''Note:''' All interface images shown on this page are mockups and design concepts, not actual game footage.

== System Philosophy ==

The NPC system rewards '''strategic specialization''' and '''emotional investment''':
* '''Living Base Environment''': NPCs create a dynamic, inhabited feeling through movement and interaction
* '''Strategic Specialization''': Different NPC types enable completely different playstyles
* '''Emotional Stakes''': NPC death creates genuine loss and strategic setbacks
* '''Expandable Content''': Each NPC group supports multiple character archetypes for ongoing expansion

=== Strategic NPC Selection System ===
'''Choose your team composition for completely different playstyles'''

==== Core Design Principles ====
* '''4 Expandable NPC Groups''': Each group offers distinct main buff specializations
* '''Scalable Content System''': Easy to design new NPCs within established groups for continuous expansion
* '''Immersive Base Interactions''': NPCs visibly stationed around your base, clickable for unique dialogue
* '''Voice-Over Dialogue System''': Each NPC has distinct voice acting with walkie-talkie static effects
* '''Post-Apocalyptic Atmosphere''': Radio static enhances survival immersion and NPC connection

==== Fundamental Gameplay Impact ====
Each NPC group creates fundamentally different strategic approaches and gameplay experiences, allowing players to customize their survival strategy through character selection.

== NPC Recruitment System ==

=== Recruitment Mechanics ===
'''Exclusive choice system with permanent consequences'''

==== Trigger Events ====
* '''Specific Day Encounters''': Recruitment opportunities occur on predetermined days
* '''Binary Choices''': Each encounter presents exactly 2 NPC options
* '''Exclusive Selection''': Choose only one NPC per recruitment event
* '''Permanent Integration''': Selected NPCs remain until potential expedition death
