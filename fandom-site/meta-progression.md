# Meta Progression (Research System)

The '''Meta Progression''' system in City Defense Z provides permanent upgrades that persist across all runs, allowing players to grow stronger over time through strategic investment of [[File:Research_Icon.png|32px]] '''Research Points'''.

== Overview ==

The Research system follows a '''three-tier progression structure''' that rewards both short-term tactical play and long-term strategic planning:

{| class="wikitable" style="width:100%;"
! style="width:15%;" | '''Tier'''
! style="width:20%;" | '''Scope'''
! style="width:65%;" | '''Key Elements'''
|-
| '''Session''' || Within Single Run || Building/resource evolution, tactical mastery, strategic learning
|-
| '''Campaign''' || Across Multiple Runs || Research Point upgrades, map unlocks, system access, NPC collection  
|-
| '''Mastery''' || Long-term Engagement || Strategic optimization, build variety, challenge completion
|}

== Research Points ==

[[File:Research_Icon.png|32px]] '''Research Points (RP)''' are the primary currency for permanent upgrades.

=== Generation Sources ===
* '''[[File:LaboratoryIcon.png|32px]] <span style="color:blue">'''[[Buildings#Laboratory Buildings (Blue)|Laboratory Buildings]]'''</span>''' - Primary generation method
* '''Expeditions''' - Secondary RP source
* '''Run Completion''' - Bonus RP for successful defense
* '''3-Day Offerings''' - Special ritual rewards
* '''Map Completion''' - Milestone bonuses (25-150 RP)
* '''Boss Defeats''' - Major achievement rewards
* '''Achievements''' - Various completion bonuses

'''Typical Yield:''' 15-60 RP per standard run, with milestone bonuses providing 25-150 RP.

== Upgrade Trees ==

The Research system features '''11 major upgrade trees''' with over 40 individual upgrades available:
