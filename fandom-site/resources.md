# Resources & Economy Guide

The '''Resource & Economy System''' in City Defense Z balances immediate tactical survival needs with long-term strategic investment through meaningful resource allocation decisions. Success requires mastering the '''manual collection system''' and understanding the interconnected relationships between all five currency types.

== Economic Philosophy ==

City Defense Z's economy rewards '''active management''' and '''strategic planning''':
* '''Immediate vs Long-term''': Balance current survival needs with meta progression investment
* '''Active Engagement''': Manual collection system requires player interaction during day phases  
* '''Interconnected Systems''': All currencies affect each other's strategic utility
* '''Dynamic Scaling''': Resource needs increase with base complexity and map difficulty

----

== The Five Currency Types ==

=== [[File:Resource_Icon.png|32px]] Resource (Primary Currency) ===
'''The backbone of base expansion and daily operations'''

==== Generation Sources ====
* '''<span style="color:gold">'''[[Buildings#Factory Buildings (Yellow)|Factory Buildings]]'''</span>''' - Primary generation method
* '''Expeditions''' - Secondary resource rewards

==== Primary Uses ====
{| class="wikitable"
! Use Case !! Cost Range !! Strategic Importance
|-
| '''Building Cards''' || 8-12 [[File:Resource_Icon.png|32px]] || Essential for base expansion
|-
| '''Utility Cards''' || 15-20 [[File:Resource_Icon.png|32px]] || Building Relocation, Direct Level-Up
|-
| '''Base Management''' || Variable || Infrastructure and maintenance
|-
| '''Emergency Purchases''' || Variable || Crisis response options
|}

==== Resource Strategy ====
* '''Early Priority''': Focus on Factory building merges for increased generation
* '''Daily Planning''': Reserve 24-36 resources for essential daily cards
* '''Emergency Buffer''': Keep 30+ resources for unexpected needs
* '''Late Game''': Resource becomes less limiting as production scales up

----

=== [[File:Ammunition_Icon.png|32px]] Ammunition (Military Currency) ===
'''Essential for all combat and defensive operations'''

==== Generation Sources ====
* '''<span style="color:green">'''[[Buildings#Ammunition Buildings (Green)|Ammunition Buildings]]'''</span>''' - Primary generation method
* '''Expeditions''' - Military supply rewards

==== Primary Uses ====
{| class="wikitable"
! Use Case !! [[File:Ammunition_Icon.png|32px]] Cost !! Strategic Importance
|-
| '''Heavy Weapons''' || Variable [[File:Ammunition_Icon.png|32px]] || Mortar, Machine Gun (Bixi), Rocket Launcher
|-
| '''Defensive Structures''' || Variable [[File:Ammunition_Icon.png|32px]] || Landmines, Outpost Towers, Defense Walls
|-
| '''Airstrikes''' || 15-25 [[File:Ammunition_Icon.png|32px]] || Tactical bombardment support
|-
| '''Military Infrastructure''' || Variable [[File:Ammunition_Icon.png|32px]] || Essential for base defense
|}

'''Note:''' Basic Soldiers are generated by <span style="color:orange">'''[[Buildings#Barracks Buildings (Orange)|Barracks Buildings]]'''</span> and do not require ammunition to produce.

==== Ammunition Strategy ====
* '''Critical Resource''': Shortage = inability to defend effectively
* '''Production Scaling''': Higher-level Ammunition buildings provide exponential returns
* '''Combat Planning''': Calculate ammunition needs before night phase
* '''Research Investment''': <span style="color:green">'''[[Meta Progression (Research System)#10. Airstrike Upgrade|Airstrike upgrades]]'''</span> reduce costs by 50%

'''Warning:''' Running out of ammunition during zombie waves often results in base destruction.
