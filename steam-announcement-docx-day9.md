The defense holds, Survivors...

DAY 9: THE RESOURCES THAT SUSTAIN

In the ruins of civilization, survival hinges on what you can build, harvest, and protect.

Your base starts as a desperate outpost, but through clever management, it becomes a fortress of production.

From Scattered Survival...

Begin with simple factories generating essential supplies. But true power comes from combination.

[GIF PLACEHOLDER: Three factories merging into one advanced]

Merge three identical structures to forge something greater - more efficient, more productive, a cornerstone of your economy.

Watch your network evolve from basic survival to industrial might.

But resources are more than stockpiles - they're interconnected:

Ammunition to arm your forces.

Food to sustain your people.

Research to unlock eternal advantages.

The Choice is Yours

Will you build an economic empire of factories? Stockpile ammunition for endless warfare? Or pursue knowledge that persists beyond defeat?

Five vital resources. Endless strategic depth. One crucial question: Can your economy outlast the apocalypse?
